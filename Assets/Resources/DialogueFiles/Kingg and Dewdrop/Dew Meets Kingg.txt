[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Neutral] Uh… excuse me?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Surprised] Oh! Hello new face! 
[sprite=Neutral] Who are you traveller?
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Neutral] I'm Dewdrop. 
I was told I could find the head of the village here?
[character=Kingg] Oh, my dear, you have found me. 
I am Kingg, leader of this fine fearful folk!
[character=Dewdrop] Perfect. So, I need a sail and a net for the ship down at the damn. I hear your village has supplies.
[character=Kingg][sprite=Surprised] Ah. Yes. We did have them. Wonderful, sturdy, reliable supplies. 
[sprite=Scared] Until… It came.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Confused] It?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Scared] That creature—that beast! 
It came through town one night, taking our goods, and scared the village half to death! Naturally, we took action. 
[sprite=Neutral]And by 'we,' I mean 'I,' because no one else had the fortitude to face such a menace.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Confused] So… What happened? Where is it now?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Surprised] We, uh… We locked it in the sewers.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Unhappy] You just locked it up?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Neutral] Obviously! What else would one do with a terrifying, supply-stealing creature? Give it a room at the inn?
[character=Dewdrop] If it has your supplies, then that is where I have to go… Where is the key to the sewers?
[character=Kingg] Well, you see… I had the key. And then the key had the misfortune of, um… disappearing
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Unhappy] You lost the key?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Neutral] Lost is such a strong word! It's more like… absconded?
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Unhappy] Great. So what now?
[character=Kingg][sprite=Neutral] Only something liquid can slip through the sewer grate and reach the beast's den. 
So unless you have some magical water powers that let you turn into water, you'll have to find another way down.
You could ask Quinn for help? He's always got such oddly useful items.
