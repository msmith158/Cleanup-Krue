[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral]Test
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Neutral] Hello?
[character=Quinn][sprite=surprised] Well now, I didn't expect company today, and certainly not a half-drowned water spirit.
[sprite=neutral] You good, or should I fish you up a towel?
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Confused] I'm… I think I’m ok. But where am I? My head is a little fuzzy. I know Im meant to be doing something important.
[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral] You're confused, I get it. Spirits don't usually just… wake up outta nowhere. Alright, lets get you up to speed.
 [sprite=Happy] Name's Quinn. Merchant, traveller, collector of oddities. And you?
[character=Dewdrop] Dewdrop.
[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral] See? We're making progress already.
As for where you are, you're on Krue. Once lush and lively, but now? In need of a fixer-upper. 
But luckily for us, you have been woken up in the middle of all this mess.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Confused] That sounds awful… But what does that have to do with me?
[character=Quinn][sprite=neutral] Because, Dewdrop, you're kind of a big deal. 
You're a water spirit, and spirits like you keep the balance. My guess? This place got so bad, the world decided to hit the emergency reset button—<i>you</i>.
[character=Dewdrop] So I have to fix all this?
[character=Quinn][sprite=surprised] Whoa, whoa, let's not dump the entire planet on your shoulders just yet. 
[sprite=neutral] Spirits have got 'purification magic' and from what I've read it's a fancy way of saying you make gross things <i>not</i> gross. Thats why we need you.
But, and here's the kicker, you're running on fumes right now.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=confused] What do you mean?
[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral] Water spirits need, well… <i>water</i>. And judging by the quality of this stuff, you're not exactly sipping on the finest spring water. 
But don't worry, I've got a plan.
Theres a village nearby who's trying to clean this place up, but they're short on supplies. They need a new sail and a net for that boat over there. 
You help get replacements, they get to work, and that helps you get stronger. Circle of life, purification edition. 
Fair trade, yeah?
[character=Dewdrop] So if I help them, they'll help me?
[character=Quinn][sprite=Happy] Now you're getting it! Look at us, teamwork already. 
[sprite=Neutral] Head to the village and they'll point you in the right direction. 
Oh, and heads up—there's a Magfly nest nearby, and thanks to all this corruption, they've got attitude. 
If they see you find a place to hide. They're not the patient type—they'll move on if you stay outta sight.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Neutral] Got it. Thank you, Quinn.
[character=Quinn] Anytime, Dew. Now go be a hero or whatever.
