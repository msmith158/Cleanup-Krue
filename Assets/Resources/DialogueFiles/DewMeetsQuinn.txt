[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral]Test
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Neutral] Hello?
[characater=Quinn][sprite=surprised] Well now, I didn't expect company today, and certainly not a half-drowned water spirit.
[sprite=neutral] You good, or should I fish you up a towel?
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=neutral] I'm… I think Im ok. But where am I? My head is a little fuzzy. I know Im meant to be doing something important.
[character=Quinn] You're confused, I get it. Spirits don't usually just… wake up outta nowhere. Alright, lets get you up to speed.
 Name's Quin. Merchant, traveller, collector of oddities. And you?
[character=Dewdrop] Dewdrop.
[character=Quinn] See? We're making progress already.
As for where you are, you're on Krue. Once lush and lively, but now? In need of a fixer-upper. 
But luckily for us, you, my friend, have woken up in the middle of all mess.
[character=Dewdrop][sprite=Confused] That sounds awful… But what does that have to do with me?
