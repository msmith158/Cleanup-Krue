[character=Quinn][sprite=Neutral]I've got a question for you, Caspian.
[character=Caspian]Go on.
[character=Quinn]So you know how the other day, I asked you for some ingredients for my healing potion?
Seeing as you had some ingredients I couldn't find myself.
[character=Caspian]Right?
[character=Quinn]And you said you didn't have any left?
[character=Caspian]Yeah?
[character=Quinn]Well while you weren't looking, I snuck into your shack and had a check for myself...
[sprite=Happy]And I found some left over in boxes!
I thought you said you didn't have any!
[character=Caspian][sprite=Neutral]Oh come on, Quinn, there were barely any left in there.
I thought you needed a bigger batch than that.
[character=Quinn]Well yeah, I did. I just thought you had <i>none</i>, not a few left over.
[character=Caspian]Okay? Does it matter if you couldn't even use what was left anyway?
And besides, I was getting more of those ingredients so you could have a new batch.
[character=Quinn][sprite=Happy]Yeah, I guess you're right.
[sprite=Neutral]Well anyway, I gotta run.
[character=Caspian]Alright, bye.

Wait... <b>YOU ENTERED MY SHACK WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?!</b>
